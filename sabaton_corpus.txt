When the winged hussars arrived

A cry for help in time of need, await relief from holy league
60 days of siege, outnumbered and weak
Sent a message to the sky, wounded soldiers left to die
Will they hold the wall or will the city fall

Dedication
Dedication
They're outnumbered 15 to one
And the battle's begun

Then the winged hussars arrived
Coming down the mountainside
Then the winged hussars arrived
Coming down they turned the tide

As the days are passing by and as the dead are piling high
No escape and no salvation
Trenches to explosive halls are buried deep beneath the walls
Plant the charges there and watch the city fear

Desperation
Desperation
It's a desperate race against the mine
And a race against time

Then the winged hussars arrived
Coming down the mountainside
Then the winged hussars arrived
Coming down they turned the tide

Cannonballs are coming down from the sky
Janissaries are you ready to die?
We will seek our vengeance eye for an eye

You'll be stopped upon the steps of our gate
On this field you're only facing our hate
But back home the sultan's sealing your fate

We remember
In September
That's the night Vienna was freed
We made the enemy bleed!

Storm clouds, fire and steel
Death from above make their enemy kneel

Fast as the wind, the invasion has begun
Shaking the ground with the force of thousand guns
First in the line of fire, first into hostile land
Tanks leading the way, leading the way
Charging the lines with the force of a furious storm
Fast as the lighting phantoms swarm
200 miles at nightfall, taken within a day
Thus earning their name, earning the fame
They are the panzer elite, born to compete, never retreat (ghost division)
Leaving or dead, always ahead, fed by your dread
Always ahead, as the blitzkrieg rages on
Breaking morale the with the sound of blazing guns
First in the line of fire, first into hostile land
Tanks leading the way, leading the way
Leaving a trail of destruction to a foreign land
(Waging war with conviction)
Massive assault made to serve the Nazi plan
(Wehrmacht's pride, ghost division)
Communication's broken, phantom's are far away
Thus earning their name, earning the fame
They are the panzer elite, born to compete, never retreat (ghost division)
Leaving or dead, always ahead, fed by your dread
Pushing the frontline forth with a tremendous force
(Far ahead, breaks resistance)
Reaching the way for panzer corps
(Shows no fear, self-subsistent)
First in the line of fire, first into hostile land
Thus earning the name, claiming the fame
They are the panzer elite, born to compete, never retreat (ghost division)
Leaving or dead, always ahead, fed by your dread
Panzer elite, born to compete, never retreat (ghost division)
Leaving or dead, always ahead, fed by your dread

Into the motherland
The German army march
In the Soviet Union summer 1943
Tanks line up in thousands as far the eye can see
Ready for the onslaught
Ready for the fight
Waiting for the axis to march into a trap
Mines are placed in darkness
In the cover of the night
Waiting to be triggered
When the time is right
Imminent invasion, imminent attack
Once the battle started
There's no turning back
The end of the third Reich draws near
It's time has come to an end
The end of an era is here
It's time to attack!
Into the motherland the German army march
Comrades stand side by side to stop the Nazi charge
Panzers on Russian soil a thunder in the east
One million men at war
Soviet wrath unleashed!
Fields of Prokhorovka
Where the heat of battle burned
Suffered heavy losses
And the tide of war was turned
Driving back the Germans
Fighting on four fronts
Hunt them out of Russia
Out of Soviet land
Reinforce the front line
Force the axis to retreat
Send in all the reserves
Securing their defeat
Soldiers of the Union
Broke the citadel
Ruins of an army
Axis rest in hell
The end of the third Reich draws near
Its time has come to an end
The end of an era is here
Its time to attack
Into the motherland the German army march
Comrades stand side by side to stop the Nazi charge
Panzers on Russian soil a thunder in the east
One million men at war
Soviet wrath unleashed!
Onward comrads! Onwards for the Soviet Union! Charge!
Ow mother Russia!
Union of lands
Will of the people
Strong in command
Ow mother Russia!
Union of lands
Once more victorious the red army stands!
The end of the third Reich is here
Its time has come to an end
The end of an era is here
Its time to attack!
Into the motherland the German army march
Comrades stand side by side to stop the Nazi charge
Panzers on Russian soil a thunder in the east
One million men at war
Soviet wrath unleashed!

Through the gates of hell
As we make our way to heaven
Through the Nazi lines
Primo victoria
We've been training for years
Now we're ready to strike
As the great operation begins
We're the first wave on the shore
We're the first ones to fall
Yet soldiers have fallen before
In the dawn they will pay
With their lives as the price
History's written today
In this burning inferno
Know that nothing remains
As our forces advance on the beach
Aiming for heaven though serving in hell
Victory is ours their forces will fall
Through the gates of hell
As we make our way to heaven
Through the Nazi lines
Primo victoria
On the 6th of June
On the shores of western Europe 1944
D-day upon us
We've been here before
Used to this kind of war
Crossfire grind through the sand
Our orders were easy
It's kill or be killed
Blood on both sides will be spilled
In the dawn they will pay
With their lives as the price
History's written today
Now that we are at war
With the axis again
This time we know what will come
Aiming for heaven though serving in hell
Victory is ours their forces will fall
Through the gates of hell
As we make our way to heaven
Through the Nazi lines
Primo victoria
On 6th of June
On the shores of western Europe 1944
D-day upon us
6th of June 1944
Allies are turning the war
Normandy state of anarchy
Overlord
Aiming for heaven though serving in hell
Victory is ours their forces will fall
Through the gates of hell
As we make our way to heaven
Through the Nazi lines
Primo victoria
On 6th of June
On the shores of western Europe 1944
D-day upon us
Through the gates of hell
As we make our way to heaven
Through the Nazi lines
Primo victoria
On 6th of June
On the shores of western Europe 1944
Primo victoria


All embrace me
It's my time to rule at last
Fifteen years have I been waiting
To sit upon my throne

No allegiance
I will swear no oath
Crowned by god not by the church
As my power is divine

They thought I was too young to rule the land
Just as they failed to understand
Born to rule
My time has come

I was chosen by heaven
Say my name when you pray
To the skies
See Carolus rise
With the lord my protector
Make them bow to my will
To the skies
See Carolus rise

To the skies
See Carolus rise

Proved in battle
Led my men to victory
No man alive or dead commands me
I answer to the lord

Hear my orders
Question me and die
What I say was said in heaven
And so it shall be done

I know I was destined to rule alone
All for myself I have claimed the throne
Born to rule
My time is now

I was chosen by heaven
Say my name when you pray
To the skies
See Carolus rise
With the lord my protector
Make them bow to my will
To the skies
See Carolus rise

To the skies
See Carolus rise

Fram책t Karoliner
Fiendens dom 채r h채r
L책t oss krossa dom
Kasta in dom genom helvetets portar

All that's thine
Shall be mine
There's no stopping me
All over Europe my rule shall be questioned by none

All I see
Give to me
That is my decree
My will be done

They thought I was too young to rule the land
Just as they failed to understand
Born to rule
My time is now

I was chosen by heaven
Say my name when you pray
To the skies
See Carolus rise
To the skies

With the lord my protector
Make them bow to my will
To the skies
See Carolus rise
To the skies
See Carolus rise
